# Look at several Rails/Ruby online API sources and say which
# one you like best and why.

# I like the ruby-doc.org site the best that launch school 
# references and am most familiar with the interface and like that
# it is easy to see all the different classes and methods connected
# with the topic.  It pulls from and uses Rdoc
# (https://github.com/ruby/rdoc) It also pulls straight from 
# the source code and shows snippets of the C code for Ruby, which
# might be useful later. It provides plenty of code examples
# for everything too.  The language can be difficult for
# beginners though and sometimes things aren't explained in a
# comprehensible way to beginners.  

# The other ones I am less familiar with but like the 
# search features better within the websites of:

# https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/2.5.0 

# The "official docs" which also had a good reference to other 
# doc sites: https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/
# The layout is different and I like the in site seach tool.


# https://rubydocs.org/d/ruby-2-5-3/  

# The rubydocs.org contained docs on the builds in testing past
# 2.5.3.  And info on rails and other ruby api all on one site.
