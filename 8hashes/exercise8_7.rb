# Given the following cod...

x = "hi there"
my_hash = {x: "some value"}
my_hash2 = {x => "some value"}

# What's the difference between the two hashes that were created?

# my_hash uses the newer syntax to set the key :x as a symbol
# to the value "some value" while my_hash2 uses a different syntax
# with the => operator and x refers to the variable initialized
# of the first line with the value "Hi there". To summarize:
# different keys, variable names, syntax, and hashes.
