# What is exception handling and what problem does it solve?

# Exception handling is a process that deals with errors in a
# managable and predictable way. It alows code to still run and 
# bypass the exeption without stopping the whole code process and
# alows partial output.  It changes the flow of control without
# exiting the program entirely.
